# Food-Review-Classifier

My proposed classifier employs a two-step process: preprocessing and classification. In the
preprocessing phase, text data is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into numerical
representations, incorporating techniques like TF-IDF. This ensures that the inherent information
within reviews is preserved while reducing noise.
For classification, a binary-class machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset comprising
diverse Amazon product reviews. The model architecture captures sequential dependencies and
highlight salient features within the reviews.
